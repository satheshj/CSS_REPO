            The term atomicity defines that the data remains atomic. It means if any operation is performed on the data, either it should be performed or executed completely or should not be executed at all. It further means that the operation should not break in between or execute partially. In the case of executing operations on the transaction, the operation should be completely executed and not partially.
<br/>
Example: If Remo has account A having $30 in his account from which he wishes to send $10 to Sheero's account, which is B. In account B, a sum of $ 100 is already present. When $10 will be transferred to account B, the sum will become $110. Now, there will be two operations that will take place. One is the amount of $10 that Remo wants to transfer will be debited from his account A, and the same amount will get credited to account B, i.e., into Sheero's account. Now, what happens - the first operation of debit executes successfully, but the credit operation, however, fails. Thus, in Remo's account A, the value becomes $20, and to that of Sheero's account, it remains $100 as it was previously present.
