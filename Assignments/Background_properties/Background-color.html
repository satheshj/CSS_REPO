        <h1>A guide to designing and shipping AI developer tools</h1>
        <p>
            
            After three-plus years of concepting, designing, and shipping AI-driven developer tools, GitHub is continuing to explore new ways to bring powerful AI models into the developer workflow. Along the way, we’ve learned that the most important aspect of designing AI-driven products is to focus extensively on the developer experience (DevEx).

While it can now feel like there’s a new AI announcement from every company every week, we’re here to reflect on what it takes to build an AI product from scratch—not just to integrate an LLM into an existing product. In this article, we’ll share 10 tips for designing AI products and developer tools, and lessons we learned first-hand from designing, iterating, and extending GitHub Copilot.

Let’s jump in.
