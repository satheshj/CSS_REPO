            In CSS there are five generic font families:

Serif fonts have a small stroke at the edges of each letter. They create a sense of formality and elegance.<br/>
Sans-serif fonts have clean lines (no small strokes attached). They create a modern and minimalistic look.
Monospace fonts - here all the letters have the same fixed width. They create a mechanical look. 
Cursive fonts imitate human handwriting.
Fantasy fonts are decorative/playful fonts.
All the different font names belong to one of the generic font families.
